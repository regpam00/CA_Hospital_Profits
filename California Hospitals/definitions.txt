The item types are:
GR_PT_REV – Gross Routine Patient Revenue
DED_REV_PLUS_DSH – Deductions from Revenue plus Disproportionate Share Intergovernmental Transfer Amount
TOT_CAP_REV – Total Capitation Revenue
NET_REV_LESS_DSH – Net Patient Revenue less Disproportionate Share Intergovernmental Transfer Amount
OTH_OP_REV – Other Operating Revenue
TOT_OP_EXP – Total Operating Expense
NET_OP_LESS_DSH – Net from Operations less Disproportionate Share Intergovernmental Transfer Amount
NONOP_REV – Non-operating Revenue
NONOP_EXP – Non-operating Expense
INC_TAX – Income Tax
EXT_ITEM – Extraordinary Items
NET_INC_LESS_DSH – Net Income less Disproportionate Share Transfer Amount
OPERATING_MARGIN -Net income from operations divided by total operating revenue (net patient revenue plus other operating revenue). This ratio indicates the percentage of net patient revenue which remains as income after operating expenses.

GR_PT_REV + TOT_OP_EXP - DED_REV_PLUS_DSH = NET_REV_LESS_DSH 
NET_REV_LESS_DSH + OTH_OP_REV - TOT_OP_EXP = NET_OP_LESS_DSH
NET_OP_LESS_DSH + NONOP_REV + NONOP_EXP - INC_TAX + EXT_ITEM = NET_INC_LESS_DSH

OPERATING_MARGIN = ((NET_OP_LESS_DSH)/(NET_REV_LESS_DSH + OTH_OP_REV)) * 100
